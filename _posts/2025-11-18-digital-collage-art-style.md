title: Learning about 'digital collage' art style
tags: [ design ]
---

I've been interested in digital collage art lately. I was generally aware of the art style, but I recently stumbled onto the work of Ben Stafford on who creates collages that avoid the busyiness I usually associate with these designs.

Today, I dedicated some time to exploring the designs that really inspire me. I studied them, trying to break down the elements, texture overlays, precise masking, intentional use of negative space, and bold color palettes.

This deep dive has given me a clear roadmap for learning.
