# Exploring how AI handles real business problems

## Context

A work mate and I set ourselves a simple challenge. We wanted to understand the limits of AI in a real workplace setting. We chose a very small part of a process so we could see what the tool could actually do.

Sales data felt like a strong place to begin. It updates often and shapes many decisions. It is also an area where we knew we wanted faster pathways from data to actions.

## How we set up the workflow

We used an internal AI tool and designed a clear flow.

Every Monday we took a screenshot of our sales dashboard. Then we uploaded the screenshot with a prompt. The AI would read the figures and produce a table that summarised the key metrics.

## Issues encountered

This was where we ran into our first constraint. The AI could read the numbers but could not tell if the results were good or bad for the business. To fix this, we defined thresholds for each metric. These thresholds created a traffic light system and a suggested next action.

Once we added the traffic lights, everything became quicker. We could sort the table by colour and use leader time on the areas that mattered most. The experience showed that a tool needs a policy before it can behave in a useful way. We had to write that policy ourselves. We also had to make sure the input data was stable and easy for the AI to interpret.

## Lessons learned

A few lessons stood out as we refined the process.

We had to reduce the creativity setting on the AI. Creative answers were interesting but not reliable for this task. We also learned that large prompts forced the system to rush. Breaking requests into smaller steps created better accuracy. Markdown style rules were understood more clearly than plain text directions.

## What next?

Now we are exploring what could come next.

Some of the recommended actions might be carried out automatically as soon as the AI finishes its run. That could help reduce slow follow ups. We also want the bot to output logs. A clear log would let a checker confirm that the tool applied the rules correctly.

This small test showed us that AI can add value when the process is structured.
