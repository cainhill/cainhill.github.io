## Default picture direction

I'm currently trying to apply a 3 second default duration across a set of pictures in a Shotcut timeline, and there is some technique required.[^1]

Shotcut needs the default duration of pictures set **before** you import the pictures into the Playlist. If you are trying to set the duration of the clips in the Timeline, you've gone too far. The default duration is only applied at the point that you "Add Files" to Playlist or Bin(s).

## Subtitle timing

Use **Alt + Left** or **Alt + Right** to move the timeline cursor to the start/end of the clip. Then use the subtitle window to mark the start/end of the subtitle.
