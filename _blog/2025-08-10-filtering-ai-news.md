title: Use this checklist to cut through AI headlines
---

**Quick Summary:**

To focus on practical and quality parts of the AI discussion, I suggest we pay attention to demonstrated work, problem-proximity, and craft-relevance.

**Goal:**

In 2025, we have been inundated by content about Artifical Intelligence and a collective urgency to understand as much as we can about it. But there is too much to absorb about this topic, so I am applying the following checklist to my newsfeeds with the goal of prioritising practical and quality information.

**Checklist:**

I have started to only read/watch content about AI when that content has:

1. **Demonstrated Work**:  The author has undertaken some measure of direct work and has findings to report. This check eliminates speculative journalism and panel discussions.

2. **Problem Focus**: The author has clearly started from a pre-existing problem that was felt before AI.

3. **Craft Relevance**: The author is in a similar field to mine and their reflections are relevant to my craft.
