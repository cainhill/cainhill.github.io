title: Use this checklist to cut through AI headlines
---

**Quick Summary:** In 2025, we have been inundated by a frenzy of content about Artifical Intelligence and a collective urgency to understand as much as we can about it. To sort signal from noise, I am applying the following checklist to my newsfeeds. The goal is to absorb content that is high-quality and practical.

With few exceptions, I have started to only read/watch content about AI when that content has:

1. **Demonstrated Work**:  The author has undertaken some measure of direct work and has findings to report.

2. **Problem Proximity**: The author has clearly started from a pre-existing problem that was felt before AI.
