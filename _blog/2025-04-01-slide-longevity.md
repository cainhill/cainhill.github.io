title: Make PowerPoint slides that survive rebrands and restructures
---
**Quick Summary:** There are 4 rules I follow for internal company PowerPoints to ensure those slides survive rebrands and restructures.

1. Never recreate, screenshot & cite instead
2. Only link to stable URLs
3. Use neutral slide colours
4. Make it easy to invert your slide colours

## Problem
Organisations that use PowerPoints as a store for important reference information often waste time keeping those presentations aligned to the latest company design - but did you know that a few simple rules can prevent that rework?

## The Techniques

1. **Never recreate, screenshot & cite instead**
   Especially for internal presentations, it is a huge waste of time to recreate diagrams or tables that could just have been screenshots with citations back to the source. In most cases, it is better to have a screenshot so the reader understands that the data is not mastered in the PowerPoint. I recommend using greyscale for screenshots as a visual indicator and giving a link back to the source so readers can self-source fresh information.

2. **Only save and link to stable URLs**
   In general, the only safe places to link in an organisation are the company intranet pages or a place that will not be restructured lightlym For this reason, it is not good to link from a PowerPoint to an MsTeams file, since MsTeams groups are temporary and can vanish easily, breaking your link.

3. **Use neutral slide colours**
   Use of grey boxes and black borders is preferred. From year to year, there may be changes in the exact logo for an organisation, but shades of grey work with whichever accent colour is chosen for the year.

4. **Make it easy to invert your slide colours**
   If you use the right PowerPoint templates, it is easy to switch a whole presentation file to Dark Mode. This is important to stay adaptable to year where organisations want to switch to white text on black backgrounds.
