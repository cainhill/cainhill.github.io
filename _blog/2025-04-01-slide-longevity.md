title: Make PowerPoint slides that survive rebrands and restructures
---
**Quick Summary:** There are 5 rules everyone should follow for internal company PowerPoints to ensure those slides survive rebrands and restructures.

1. Never recreate, screenshot&cite instead
2. Only link to stable URLs
3. Use neutral slide colours
4. Make it easy to invert your slide colours

**Problem:**
Organisations that use PowerPoints as a store for important reference information often waste time keeping those presentations aligned to the latest company design - when a few simple rules can prevent this avoidable rework.

**1. Never recreate, screenshot&cite instead**
Especially for internal presentations, it is a huge waste of time to recreate diagrams or tables that could just have been screenshots with citations back to the source. In most cases, it is better to have a screenshot so the reader understands that the data is not mastered in the PowerPoint. I recommend using greyscale for screenshots as a visual indicator and giving a link back to the source so readers can self-source fresh information.

2. Only save and link to stable URLs


3. Don't recreate - screenshot & cite instead


4. Use neutral slide colours


5. Make it easy to invert your slide colours









The Confusion:

When a presentation is discussed but not uploaded to a share drive that everyone can access.
When someone joins your organisation and you can’t find last year’s presentation.




the default communication tool for enterprise meetings across the world, and yet the way we prepare/store/share them causes so much wasted time.



But I am interested in one PowerPoint problem above all others: 




When presentation files aren’t stored or shared properly, organisations lose valuable knowledge.

How can we build PowerPoint slides that

forcing teams to revisit the same discussions because no one can find the original file. Even when content is meant to last, frequent rebrands and design changes create unnecessary rework, making it harder to keep insights intact. The real challenge is ensuring that presentations become part of the team’s collective knowledge while staying resilient to future updates. My four rules provide a practical way to achieve this, so your work remains useful and accessible over time.



The way many organisations use PowerPoint means slides often have only temporary impact. Hours go into crafting a deck, but once the meeting is over, it’s quickly forgotten—lost in inboxes, buried in shared drives, or never seen by those who need it later. Important decisions and insights fade, while new team members miss key context. Worse, too much time is spent perfecting design rather than strengthening content. After ten years working across large enterprises, I’ve developed four simple rules to help your slides stay useful long after the meeting ends.



Critical insights, decisions, and rationale vanish into inboxes or shared drives with no clear home, making it nearly impossible for teams to rediscover or build on past work. Meanwhile, endless formatting tweaks and shifting design standards consume more energy than the content itself, turning presentations into a cycle of rework rather than a tool for progress. After a decade working across large enterprise client engagements, I’ve developed four simple rules to ensure your slides have lasting impact—so your work doesn’t just look good for a meeting but remains valuable long after.
