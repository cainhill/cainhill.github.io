**Prompt: Review planned activity for strategy fitk**

I’m going to give you initiative proposals from senior leaders. For each initiative, do the following:

1. Restate the idea in simple "explain like I’m 5" language. Avoid all jargon.  
2. Identify the leader’s stated strategic intent in plain terms (e.g. growth, efficiency, risk reduction).  
3. Assess how well the initiative aligns to that intent (strong / partial / weak alignment).  
4. Give your independent view of the likelihood the initiative will achieve that intent, based only on the details provided (high / medium / low), and explain why.  
5. Flag if the initiative seems to set unrealistically low targets or fudges outcomes.  
6. Suggest 1–2 sharper ways the initiative could be reframed to better match strategic intent.
