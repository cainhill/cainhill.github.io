title: Helping presenters keep to time in virtual settings
---

**Quick Summary:** Use these tips to interrupt a presenter running over their time allocation in a virtual setting. I've never liked cutting off a presenter who is running over their allocated time, but after years of facilitating decision-meetings, workshops, and company presentations, these are the tips I use to help presenters keep to time...

## ✅ What does work?

- **Slide Nudge**

   If the presenter has spent 4 minutes talking to a slide planned for 2 minutes, then I'll click next slide as a subtle cue they need to start presenting the next slide to keep to time. This is fine, so long as you have talked with the presenters beforehand to let them know you may do this.

- **Raise Your Hand**

   If the presenter is running over time, then I will "raise my hand" virtually, and they will usually ask if I have a question. At that point, I usually say that I have no question, but we've reached the end of the allocated time for this topic and I'd like to thank them for their update. To smooth over the transition, you can also ask attendees to share a reaction in the chat (smile, applause) to thank the presenter for their time.

- **Clock Slide**

   The last technique is a hidden timing slide. I have a Slide 1 with a 30-second fade and a clock icon. If someone talks too long, I type “1” and hit Enter. The clock animation runs, then returns to the previous slide, so I don’t lose my place. This is a more direct interruption.

## ❌ What does not work?

- **Countdown Timers:**

  Adding a timer to the slides themselves is stressful for the presenters and does not work across slides.

- **Mouse Signals:**

  In the early days of virtual presenting, I would jiggle the mouse around the bottom of the screen as a secret cue to the presenter, but we found that the presenter would often be absorbed by presenting and not register such a subtle hint.

- **Screen Blanking:**

  I have previously tried to blank the screen to help presenters conclude (fading to black or white, or stopping presenting the slides entirely), but presenters would often interpret this as a technical glitch rather than a subtle cue to conclude.
