title: Modern techniques for keeping virtual presentations on time
---

**Quick Summary:** Use these tips to interrupt a presenter running over their time allocation.

I've never liked cutting off a presenter who is running over their allocated time, but after years of facilitating decision-meetings, workshops, and company presentations, these are the tips I use to help presenters keep to time...

1. ⏩ **Slide Nudge**
If the presenter has spent 4 minutes talking to a slide planned for 2 minutes, then I'll click next slide as a subtle cue they need to start presenting the next slide to keep to time. This is fine, so long as you have talked with the presenters beforehand to let them know you may do this.

2. ✋ **Raise Your Hand**
If the presenter is running over time, then I will "raise my hand" virtually, and they will usually ask if I have a question. At that point, I usually say that I have no question, but we've reached the end of the allocated time for this topic and I'd like to thank them for their update. To smooth over the transition, you can also ask attendees to share a reaction in the chat (smile, applause) to thank the presenter for their time.

3. 🕒 **Clock Slide**
The last technique is a hidden timing slide. I have a Slide 1 with a 30-second fade and a clock icon. If someone talks too long, I type “1” and hit Enter. The clock animation runs, then returns to the previous slide, so I don’t lose my place. This is a more direct interruption.

These tips can be used in addition to other popular advice: setting clear timing allocations, briefing your presenters, running a practice presentation, or giving presenters timers.

**What does not work?**

❌ Putting a countdown timer on the slides themselves is stressful for the presenters and does not work across slides.
❌ Signalling the presenter by moving the mouse cursor around on the screen.
❌ I have previously tried to fade to black or white, or stop presenting the slides entirely, but interestingly presenters would often interpret this as a technical glitch rather than a subtle cue to conclude.
