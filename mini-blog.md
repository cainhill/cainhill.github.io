**Use mind maps to reconnect with the higher purpose of daily tasks**
This January, the normal New Year enthusiasm was more pronounced than usual around the office. And it was honestly quite noisy. Too many priorities competing for attention and importance. This week, I found the key to focus was to go back to reliable mind mapping, where I could see the key areas of my responsibility and the concrete activities I should be taking in the next few months to make progress. Sometimes it's helpful to get back to basics and the mindmap was perfect for recognising the bigger picture I was subconsciously working towards.
