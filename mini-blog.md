Found this artist [Kooky Craftables](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ6EZ7P9uuMv133bMmYkV1g) while looking at printer reviews. I love the creativity and how he's made templated paper craft anyone can assemble.

**Use mind maps to reconnect with the higher purpose of daily tasks**

This January, the normal New Year enthusiasm was more pronounced than usual around the office. And it was honestly quite noisy. Too many priorities competing for attention and importance. This week, I found the key to focus was to go back to reliable mind mapping, where I could see the key areas of my responsibility and the concrete activities I should be taking in the next few months to make progress. Sometimes it's helpful to get back to basics and the mindmap was perfect for recognising the bigger picture I was subconsciously working towards.

**Awesome blog**

This week I found this blog [heydingus.net](heydingus.net) with some truly enjoyable perspectives. It’s made me wonder how I might organise my own website to better reflect my own interests. I've been impressed by the author's mini blog, similar to my own, as well as the topics.

**Slides should be marked as approved for re-use to give sub-teams the tools to repeat messages clearly**

I’ve been thinking about how to simplify communication cascade in large organisations and I’ve landed on an approach that I want to test. In 2024, I will put a “stamp” on presentation slides to encourage sub-teams to re-use the content I make into their regular team and internal project meetings. I’m hoping that marking these slides especially for re-use will help teams avoid rework and improve information cascade.
