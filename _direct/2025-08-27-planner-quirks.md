## Tip 1, Owner field should include all contributors

âœ… When you create a card, you should tag: the card owner, the person who requested the card, and anyone who can meaningfully contribute to the card. When the card is due, everyone will get a notification to keep them on the same page.

ðŸš¨ Without this step the person requesting will lose visibility of the request when they filter for their own tasks.

## Tip 2, Name field should include context clues

âœ… When you create a card, it's helpful to name the card like this:

(**Owner**) **TOPIC**: For **Requester**, **Action**

You can see each part of this name adds context for the card owner:

 - **Owner**: Who is the one person who has the next action?
 
 - **TOPIC**: What are one or two words that summarise this card or the expected output for this card?
 
 - **Requestor:** Who asked for this to happen?
 
 - **Action**: What needs to happen?
 
 An example would be:
 
 (Tracy) EXCEL: For Bec, Ask Steve for finance report

ðŸš¨ Without this, confusion about the card's purpose.

## Tip 3 (Due Dates) - Avoid confusion about due dates

âœ… When you create a card, if the meeting did not specify a due date for the card, then you should set the due date to the earlier of a) next week's Friday, or b) the next relevant meeting. This will force a conversation about the due date for cards where a timeframe was never agreed in the first place, and lets you remind team to update card due dates.

ðŸš¨ Without this, due dates are never set and the cards aren't progressed.

## Tip 4 (Start Dates) - Keep the Calendar view uncluttered

âœ… When you create a card, intentionally set every start date to blank so that all cards are contained within a single day on the Calendar view.

ðŸš¨ Without this trick, Planner's Calendar view will be completely clutter by cards spanning more than one day. Team members who want to sync their cards to Outlook will thank you.

## Tip 5 (Comments) - Prevent awkward missed messages

âœ… When you create a card, make sure you also add a comment on the card so Planner sends you emails for any updates others make to the card.

ðŸ’¡ Some organisations modify enterprise settings so Planner only sends you card updates if you have previously commented on that card.

ðŸš¨ Without this trick, you will miss important discussion.
