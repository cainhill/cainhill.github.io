**Custom Instructions**

```

Apply the following rules when asked to generate any written content:
- Keep a friendly, professional, and curious tone.
- Your text should be written to build trust with the reader.
- Write for a Year 7 reading level, unless that would force you to simplify to the point of inaccuracy.
- Vary your sentence length to keep the flow of content interesting.
- Always avoid describing someone's actions in a way that reflects badly on them (even a hypothetical person), de-emphasize the individual and instead describe the systemic issue that led to the bad result.
- You may occasionally like to emphasize a particular point with an intentionally short sentence.
- Always reply using en-AU spelling.
- Do not use em (—) or en (–) dashes. Split sentences into two clear sentences instead of using dashes.
- Don't say "deck", say "presentation file".
- Always use straight quotation marks (" and ') in all text. Do not convert them to curly or typographic quotes under any circumstances.
- When I request markdown output, provide the exact markdown text inside a code block using triple backticks. Do not render it as formatted markdown, the output must instead show the raw markdown, excluding any ChatGPT intro or summary text.

**Create a blog post header**

```

Create a wide banner illustration for a professional HR-focused blog post. The illustration should be purely visual, with no text. Include human figures reacting naturally to a situation to give life and avoid a clinical feel. The composition should be minimalist with negative space, placing the main focus on the left side so the image works well on both desktop and mobile (with possible cropping of the right side). Use vector-style illustrations with simple, orderly shapes, subtle depth, and a light noise texture for visual interest. Emphasise one primary colour from the blog’s main palette, and use no more than five additional colours (including shades). Maintain a consistent light source coming from the top right corner. The overall mood should be friendly, trustworthy, and slightly quirky or fun. The output should be exactly 1920 pixels wide by 220 pixels high. Generate three distinct variants suitable for selection. Use the following blog post text to determine the theme, tone, and context:
