Getting Started
* COUNTDOWN: Trouble getting out of bed? Or starting another task? Countdown from 3..2..1..go!


Diet
* PROTEIN: Eating protein in the morning helps us stay full for longer and avoid overeating in the afternoons
* WATER: Fill a glass of water on your bedside table to drink in the morning, otherwise we often forget to hydrate ourselves


Exercise
* 10 MIN IN MORNING: Do exercise in the morning when you have the most personal resolve, and limit the exercise to 10 minutes (we don’t do well with larger commitment than that)
* WEIGHTS: Weights are better than cardio for maintaining muscle


Home Design
* OVERHEAD LIGHTS: Use lamps in every room and avoid overhead lights if you’re sensitive to that
* SUNRISE: Use the sunrise setting on Philips Hue light bulbs to wake yourself up gradually every morning
* TRANSPARENT STORAGE: For us, out of sight is out of mind, so storage should be shelves or transparent drawers we can see into
* LABELS: Label everything so it’s easier to find things and less stress knowing where to place things when putting them away
* BASKETS: If your clothes tend to pile up in corners of the house, then put a basket to catch them so it looks tidy


Friends
* QUALITY: You probably won’t have many friends who truly understand you, but you will pick a few friends who do and you will treasure them
* MAINTENANCE: People expect more effort from us than we can give sometimes to maintain a friendship, often we will gravitate to low-maintenance friends who are comfortable with us to pick up where we left off


Rest and Transition
* MENTAL REST: We are always thinking, it is urgently important for you to find ways to be mentally restful e.g. reading a book, listening to music with over ear headphones
* TRANSITION TIME: Insist on building time into your diary between things for you to mindfully stop one activity and begin a new activity


Clothes and Laundry
* PUTTING CLOTHES AWAY: Tip your clean clothes onto your bed, this will motivate you to put them away in the closet instead of leaving them in the clean clothes basket
* NIGHT BEFORE: Set out your clothes and bags the night before, so that there is less for you to do under time pressure to leave the house in the morning
* SIMPLIFY: Limit how many clothes you accumulate and donate clothes every year
* ZIP POCKETS: Especially with shorts, having zipped pockets means you’re less likely to lose things from your pockets when you sit down
* SOCKS: Buy all the same kind of sock so you don’t need to spend time pairing them
   * Alternatively, buy 15 pairs of white ankle socks and 15 pairs of long black socks
* COLD WATER: Use cold water wash for everything so colours don’t bleed and no clothes shrink
* EXPRESS LANE: Make sure bedding, towels, socks, underwear, and t-shirts get priority when deciding what to wash first
* PRE-SHRUNK SHIRTS: Either buy high-quality cotton t-shirts that come pre-shrunk or buy one size up from your normal size anticipating that they will shrink in the wash
* FOLDING: Don’t bother folding anything, but do make sure they go back in the correct clothes bins


Cleaning
* BIN BAGS: Leave bin bags on door handles so it’s less effort to put rubbish away.


Hygiene
* SOFT BRISTLES: Buy a super dense and soft toothbrush
* FLOSSING/TONGUE SCRAPING: I know the sensation may feel bad, but nightly flossing and tongue scraping is genuinely so important for healthy gums and breath
* SHOWER CLOCK: Put a clock in the shower so you keep to time and don’t run late in the morning
* EVERYTHING SHOWERS: Get wall attachments so you can store and use the following in the shower: toothbrush, toothpaste, shaver, body wash


Money
* AUTOMATE BILLS: Make a budget and then have your bank automate your monthly bill payments
* DON’T SAVE CARD DETAILS: Make it harder to do online shopping by never savings your card details in your browser or phone
* CREDIT CARDS / AFTERPAY: Never get one


Work and Productivity
* SHOES ON: For some reason, shoes on signals to the brain that it’s work time
* PASSWORD MANAGER: It will give you personal peace of mind to not need to remember all of the passwords
* MUSIC: Play brown noise, or music without words in it that are specifically designed for ADHD brains
* HEADPHONES: Use over ear headphones, especially when you need to do something boring
* STOPWATCH: Buy and use the TimeTimer Watch
* BLOCKED: When you’re blocked, try inviting someone to work alongside you. This technique is called body doubling and it can help motivate us to do the thing.
* 1.2X PLAYBACK SPEED: Listen to podcasts and videos on fast mode.


Relatable Words
* PINBALL DAY: When you have a day where you jump from one thing to the next in a bit of a chaotic way and it doesn’t feel like you’re getting much done.
* POTATO DAY: When you have a day that is low energy and you can’t compel yourself to do anything so you rest.


Diagnosis
* PROCESS: It is difficult to get an ADHD diagnosis in Australia, these are the steps I’m following:
   1. PSYCHIATRIST: Find a psychiatrist company (not psychologist) who:
      * Offers telehealth appointments
      * Can take appointments for patients in Victoria
      * Has ADHD psychiatrists
   2. PRESCRIBING GP: Find a GP:
      * Use online research to find one that advertises on their website that they are comfortable to prescribe medication for ADHD
      * Many do not
      * Actually call them and confirm it over the phone as well
   3. GP REFERRAL: Book an appointment with the GP and ask for a referral to the ADHD psychiatrist
      * In the appointment, confirm the GP would be comfortable to prescribe if given permit authority by the psychiatrist
      * Make sure the referral uses this line “Dear Psychiatrist” so changes in available psychiatrists won’t affect the validity of your referral
      * Make sure the referral asks for an item 291 or an “opinion and report”
