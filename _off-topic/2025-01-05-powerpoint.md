## Article summary

Every year, many of us lose hours to the same pointless task: reformatting old PowerPoint slides after rebrands. But it is possible to reduce reformatting effort and design PowerPoints that last if you follow these simple rules:

1. Screenshot and cite, don't recreate
2. Only link to stable URLs
3. Use neutral colours
4. Make it easy to invert colours

## We should design PowerPoints that last

Every year, many of us lose hours to the same pointless task: reformatting old PowerPoint slides after a rebrand or restructure. A new logo, new colours, or new template from head office means every deck you’ve ever made is suddenly out of date. 

I often recall [Rhonda & Karsten’s Branding Masterclass](https://youtu.be/-yHbD_7HLY4?si=840MeDuaBGSDusrw) which hilariously points out the unintended busy work and breakdowns that follow a simple logo change.
 
But here’s the truth: this rework effort isn’t inevitable. It’s the result of bad habits in how most people build PowerPoints. The majority of presentations are constructed without thinking about longevity. They look fine in the moment but collapse the second a company refreshes its brand.  

The solution is to build PowerPoints that can **withstand change**. You should be able to reuse a slide from five years ago without touching its formatting. That’s the standard we should hold ourselves to.  

Here are the four rules that make it possible:

## 1. Screenshot and cite, never recreate a slide

When you borrow a chart, a model, or a diagram from another source, don’t redraw it in your company template. That guarantees it will break the moment templates change.  

Instead:  
- Take a clean screenshot of the original
- Apply a greyscale filter
- Add a proper citation and link to the source

This way, the content stays authentic to the source and you’re not wasting time “beautifying” something that isn’t yours. Screenshots never get misaligned when the corporate colour scheme shifts.  

This echoes GitLab’s [“No Presenting in Meetings” learning session](https://www.youtube.com/live/32GJ2ehUBhs?si=C89XslkWos23lBGb) which explains that GitLab's practice is to **share source material**, not re-dressing it. The value is in the thinking, not the formatting.

## 2. Only link to stable URLs  

Links rot. Intranets get rebuilt. Shared folders vanish. Branding teams rename everything. If you link to fragile or temporary URLs, your deck becomes a dead end within months.  

Instead:  

- Use URLs you know will stay consistent such as Viva Engag Communities and avoid links to files stored on MsTeams Groups.  
- If that’s not possible, include the reference in text alongside the link, so the content is findable even if the link dies.

## 3. Use neutral slide colours  

The moment you hard-code your slides with today’s corporate palette, you’ve locked them into today’s branding. Tomorrow’s rebrand will undo your effort.  

Instead:  

- Stick to neutral colours — black, white, grey, and minimal accent tones.  
- Let the company template do the work of applying brand colours when needed.  

This way, your deck can be picked up in any era, by any template, and still look aligned.

## 4. Make it easy to invert slide colours  

Accessibility, printing, and new design systems all benefit from flexible slides. If your content is locked into light backgrounds or dark text, you’re creating future pain.  

Instead:  

- Build slides so they can invert easily — dark on light, or light on dark.  
- Avoid baked-in background images, text boxes with fixed fills, or colour-coded content that loses meaning when inverted.  

There are plenty of tips from communities like [this Reddit thread on inverting colours](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerpoint/comments/oju4jt/inverting_colours/?rdt=45456), which show just how often people face this problem after the fact. Build your deck with inversion in mind from the start, and you’ll avoid the scramble later.

## A minimum expectation for PowerPoints

This isn’t about aesthetics. It’s about respecting your own time and your audience’s time.

Every minute you spend reformatting an old deck is a minute you could have spent improving the *content*.  

So let strive to **build PowerPoints that last.**  

Follow these four rules, and you’ll stop wasting time rebranding slides, and start building presentations that survive change.
