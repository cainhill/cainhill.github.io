## ðŸŒ± Beyond Work

This part of the site is where I collect and share the things I do outside of my professional world. Itâ€™s a mix of creative projects, experiments, and reflections that donâ€™t need to fit neatly into my career story.  

<br />

## ðŸŽ¨ Creative Outlets

I enjoy exploring **digital art**, building small **apps and templates**, and even co-founding projects like **Next Level**. These are places where I get to experiment and create without pressure.  

<br />

## ðŸ“º Interests & Reflections

I also write short asides in the **mini-blog** about the shows I love (Doctor Who, Stargate, The West Wing, Drag Race, theatre), the games I play, and the lessons Iâ€™ve picked up along the way. Sometimes itâ€™s coding, automation, or home tech. Other times, itâ€™s just something that caught my attention.
