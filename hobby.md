## ðŸŒ± Beyond Work

This part of the site is where I collect and share the things I do outside of my professional world. Itâ€™s a mix of creative projects, experiments, and reflections.  

<br />

## ðŸŽ¨ Creative Outlets

In my spare time, I run learning labs for early career professionals. I make **digital art**. I create useful **apps and templates**. These are places where I get to experiment. 

<br />

## ðŸ“º Interests & Reflections

I share about my interests and reflections in my **mini-blog** about the shows I love (Doctor Who, Stargate, The West Wing, Drag Race, theatre), the games I play, and what I'm learning. Sometimes itâ€™s coding, automation, or home tech. Other times, itâ€™s just something that caught my attention.
